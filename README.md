# Bro_Sup
Bro_sup is a peer to peer platform designed to connect gamers in Cameroon and beyond who want to swap or sell their PlayStation CDs easily, securely, and locally. Many gamers own discs they no longer use but struggle to find reliable platforms, face risks of scams, and have limited options for cross city exchanges between places like Yaounde.
